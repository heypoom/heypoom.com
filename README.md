Hey there! I'm Phoomparin Mano ([@heypoom](https://twitter.com/heypoom)). This [website](https://heypoom.com) is my personal "Oasis" or "Garden" of sorts -- where I'll share my side projects, my stories, my thoughts and what I've learned in one place. Each piece of the garden will keep on expanding, so enjoy! :)
